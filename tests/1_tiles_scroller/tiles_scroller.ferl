# Ferral: Make pygame surface grass generator function, tile size is 64x64, no input arguments, call it generate_grass, make it noisy with two colors - green and white, do not import pygame, it is imported already. I need only function that returns surface

# Ferral: Make function that set global Pygame var screen, call it init_screen(). Screen size is 1280x720. Do not import pygame, it is imported already.

# Ferral: model devstral-small-2:latest
# Ferral: Make pygame function that will fill entire pygame screen with 64x64 surface copies from generate_grass func, it must be populated with copies of tile, call it fill_screen_with_grass, do not import pygame, it is imported already. Use global var called screen. Make grass_tile by calling generate_grass func, it is already in the code. Make only tiling function, nothing more.

# Ferral: Make pygame game loop function called gameloop, do not import pygame, there is global var called "running". There is global function called fill_screen_with_grass, call it on each frame. Add "global running" and "while running" loop. After calling fill_screen_with_grass func, make flip screen surface. Make only function, add close event handling there, nothing more.

running = True
init_screen()
gameloop()
